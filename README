SHORT: makes flowcharts for the LaTeX picture environment

Flow 0.99g 2004-2-18

Summary : flow reads a simple flow chart description file and produces the
          corresponding LaTeX picture environment

Files in flow099g.tar.gz

         flow.c      - plain C code, should be portable
         flowdoc.tex - documentation in LaTeX
         README      - this file
         COPYING     - GNU GPL license

Note:

flow.c uses tmpnam instead of mkstemp, gcc says this is bad, but I'm
not sure what the portability implications are when using mkstemp

flowdoc.tex is old style 2.09 LaTeX, but being vanilla LaTeX is works
fine in compatibility mode
